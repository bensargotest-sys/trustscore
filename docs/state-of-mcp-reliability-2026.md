# The State of MCP Reliability 2026

## Executive Summary (~200 words)

In 2026, TrustScore presents the first systematic assessment of Machine Control Protocol (MCP) ecosystem reliability, cataloging 201 servers across 6 providers with approximately 150 interactions recorded. This early data reveals a nascent landscape where reliability metrics are still forming. Our analysis shows that of the 201 servers, trust data is available for 50, with trust scores currently uniform at 0.5, indicating no clear differentiation in provider performance yet. This suggests that the MCP ecosystem is in an embryonic stage, lacking sufficient interaction volume to establish robust reliability patterns.

What this means for stakeholders—developers, providers, and end-users—is a critical opportunity to shape the ecosystem's future. The absence of standout performers or significant failures points to a level playing field, but also underscores the urgency for more comprehensive data collection. TrustScore's initial findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and broader participation to refine trust metrics. As MCP adoption grows, these early insights will guide decisions on provider selection and system integration. This report sets a baseline; subsequent iterations will track progress, identify leaders, and flag risks as the data matures.

## Methodology (~300 words)

TrustScore's approach to measuring MCP reliability centers on the development of trust scores—a composite metric reflecting a provider's performance across multiple dimensions, including availability, response consistency, and error rates. Trust scores range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater reliability based on historical interactions. For this 2026 assessment, data is drawn from 201 cataloged servers associated with 6 distinct providers, with approximately 150 interactions logged in our database. Each interaction captures key events such as connection success, latency, and failure modes, which are aggregated to compute a provider's trust score.

Data collection is automated through a combination of direct API queries to MCP servers and community-submitted interaction logs. Servers are identified by unique provider IDs, and a subset of 50 servers was sampled for detailed trust analysis in this report. The methodology prioritizes transparency: raw interaction data is stored in a verifiable database, and trust score calculations follow a documented algorithm that weights recent performance (last 30 days) more heavily to reflect current reliability. Limitations in data volume mean that confidence levels for these scores are currently low, often marked as "none" due to insufficient sample sizes (many providers show a sample size of 0 for specific metrics).

Quality control involves flagging providers with incomplete data or potential anomalies as "unknown_provider" to caution against over-reliance on early scores. This systematic approach, while in its infancy, establishes a reproducible framework for MCP reliability tracking. As interaction counts grow, TrustScore will refine weightings and introduce additional metrics like latency averages and success rates over 30-day windows. Community feedback on methodology is actively solicited to ensure the system evolves with real-world needs, balancing precision with usability for all MCP stakeholders.

## Current State (~500 words)

TrustScore has cataloged 201 MCP servers as of 2026, marking the first comprehensive snapshot of the Machine Control Protocol ecosystem's reliability landscape. This dataset, while preliminary, offers a foundational view into an emerging field where standardized reliability metrics have been historically absent. Of these 201 servers, trust data is available for 50, providing a limited but critical starting point for analysis. The database also records approximately 150 interactions across 6 providers, reflecting early engagement with the MCP framework.

The trust scores for the sampled servers currently stand at a uniform 0.5, indicating a neutral reliability assessment. This uniformity stems from low sample sizes—many providers have zero recorded interactions for key metrics like success rates over the past 30 days or average latency in milliseconds. As a result, confidence in these scores is rated as "none," highlighting that the data is too sparse to draw definitive conclusions about provider performance. Flags such as "unknown_provider" further caution against over-interpretation, as many entries lack the depth needed for robust evaluation. For instance, both the top and worst providers identified in our sample—Microsoft-Playwright-001 and Hamflx-Imagen3-050, respectively—share identical trust scores of 0.5 with no differentiating metrics.

This early state of the MCP ecosystem reveals several challenges. The limited number of interactions (150 across 201 servers) suggests that adoption and usage are still in their infancy, possibly due to barriers in awareness, integration complexity, or insufficient tooling for widespread MCP deployment. Moreover, the absence of variability in trust scores points to a critical data gap—without more interactions, it’s impossible to distinguish between providers who may be performing well or poorly in real-world conditions. This impacts developers and organizations relying on MCP for automation and control tasks, as they lack actionable insights to guide provider selection.

Despite these constraints, the cataloging of 201 servers is a significant step forward. It establishes a baseline for tracking reliability trends over time and provides a clear signal to the community that systematic measurement is underway. The current state underscores the need for broader participation—more servers must be monitored, and more interactions logged to build a richer dataset. TrustScore’s initial findings also suggest potential areas of focus: identifying why certain providers have no recorded data, exploring whether server configurations affect interaction quality, and determining if geographic or network factors play a role in performance.

As a first attempt at quantifying MCP reliability, this dataset of 201 servers and 50 with trust data lays the groundwork for future analysis. It’s a call to action for providers to engage with TrustScore’s monitoring tools and for users to contribute interaction logs. The ecosystem’s reliability story is just beginning, and these early numbers—though limited—set the stage for a more informed and trustworthy MCP landscape in the years ahead.

## Top Performers

In the current dataset, trust scores for all sampled providers are uniformly at 0.5, with no providers meeting the threshold of 0.8 or above to be classified as top performers. This reflects the early stage of data collection, where insufficient interaction volume (many providers have a sample size of 0 for key metrics) prevents meaningful differentiation. As an example, the highest-ranked provider in our sample, Microsoft-Playwright-001, holds a trust score of 0.5 with a confidence level of "none," indicating that the data is not yet reliable for decision-making. TrustScore anticipates identifying top performers as more interactions are logged and confidence levels improve.

## Problem Areas

Similarly, no providers in the current dataset fall below the trust score threshold of 0.5 to be flagged as problem areas. All sampled providers, including the lowest-ranked Hamflx-Imagen3-050, have a trust score of 0.5 with no differentiating performance metrics available. Low sample sizes and the "unknown_provider" flag across entries mean that potential reliability issues cannot yet be identified. TrustScore will prioritize deeper analysis of underperforming providers as data accumulates, focusing on failure patterns and user-reported issues to highlight risks.

## Patterns & Insights

At this early stage, the uniform trust score of 0.5 across providers reveals a key pattern: the MCP ecosystem lacks the interaction depth needed to uncover reliability trends. With only 150 interactions across 201 servers, and trust data for just 50, there’s no evidence yet of systemic strengths or weaknesses among providers. The "unknown_provider" flags and zero sample sizes for metrics like success rate over 30 days suggest that many MCP deployments are either untested or not integrated with TrustScore’s monitoring framework. One insight is the potential for rapid progress—since no provider stands out, small increases in interaction data could quickly shift rankings. Another observation is the critical role of community engagement; without user-submitted logs, blind spots will persist. These early patterns emphasize that reliability measurement is a collective effort, dependent on active participation from all stakeholders.

## Limitations

This report is constrained by its early-stage data. With only 150 interactions and trust data for 50 of 201 servers, the dataset is too thin to provide confident assessments—evidenced by trust scores stuck at 0.5 and confidence levels at "none." Many endpoints remain unverified, raising questions about data accuracy. The "unknown_provider" flags highlight gaps in provider-specific information, further limiting reliability insights. These constraints mean that findings should be viewed as a starting point, not a definitive guide. TrustScore acknowledges the need for significantly more data to move beyond these limitations, alongside validation of server endpoints to ensure reported interactions reflect real-world performance.

## What's Next

TrustScore is committed to continuous testing to build a more robust MCP reliability dataset. Future efforts will focus on expanding interaction logs through automated monitoring and encouraging community contributions—every user-submitted interaction helps refine trust scores. Plans include developing tools for easier data sharing and integrating with more MCP deployments to capture a wider range of server behaviors. Over the coming months, TrustScore will also explore partnerships with providers to verify endpoints and address "unknown_provider" flags. The goal is a living, evolving reliability framework that empowers users with actionable insights. Stakeholders are invited to join this effort by contributing data and feedback to shape the future of MCP trust measurement.
