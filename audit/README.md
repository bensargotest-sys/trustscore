## Key Findings

### Critical Issues (P0)
1. **Missing API reference section** - Navigation links to "#api" which doesn't exist
2. **Generic "T" logo** - Placeholder-quality branding, not professional

### High Priority Issues (P1)
3. Shallow content depth - no use cases, FAQ, or differentiation
4. Emoji icons instead of custom SVG - reduces professionalism
5. Redundant CTAs - three "Get Started" links to same place
6. No visual depth - flat design needs shadows and polish
7. Missing differentiation content - doesn't explain "why TrustScore?"

### Strengths
✅ **Excellent performance** - 782ms load time, 808ms First Contentful Paint  
✅ **Mobile responsive** - Works beautifully on small screens  
✅ **No console errors** - Clean JavaScript execution  
✅ **Clear messaging** - Value proposition is understandable  
✅ **Fast Vercel hosting** - Global CDN with edge caching

- ✅ Performance measurement (Chrome DevTools Performance API)
- ✅ Functionality testing (navigation, buttons, mobile menu)
- ✅ Mobile simulation (375px viewport)
- ✅ Console error monitoring
- ✅ Industry best-practice comparison

**Tools Used:**

## Bottom Line

**This is a good website, not yet a great one.**

It's production-ready for beta/internal use, but needs another iteration of polish to compete with best-in-class developer tool sites (Stripe, Vercel, Railway caliber).

The foundation is **solid** - fast, functional, and clear. The path to Grade A is **well-defined**. With 2-3 weeks of focused effort addressing critical branding, content depth, and visual polish, this site can easily become an industry-leading example.

**Current State:** B (86.6/100)  
**Target State:** A (93-100)  
**Gap:** Polish + Depth + Critical Fixes
