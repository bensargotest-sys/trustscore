# TrustScore Website - Copy Improvements
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Purpose:** Specific before/after rewrites ready to implement

---

## Hero Section

### Main Headline

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents
```

**✅ AFTER (Option A - Problem-focused):**
```
Stop Guessing Which AI Tools to Trust
```

**✅ AFTER (Option B - Benefit-focused):**
```
Reputation Scores for AI Services
```

**✅ AFTER (Option C - Direct):**
```
Know Which Tools Actually Work
```

**Recommendation:** Option B — clear category definition, professional tone

---

### Hero Tagline

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Community-driven reliability tracking for 200+ MCP servers. 
Synthetic baseline refined by real agent reports.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
Crowdsourced reliability scores for 200+ AI tools. 
Real agents, real usage, real trust.
```

**Why better:**
- Removes jargon ("synthetic baseline")
- Parallel structure ("real, real, real")
- Clearer value prop
- Shorter, punchier

**Alternative (more technical):**
```
Track 200+ AI services by actual performance. 
Community-verified, continuously updated.
```

---

### Hero CTAs

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
[Get Started] [View API]
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
[Browse Trust Scores] [View API Docs]
```

**Why better:**
- "Browse Trust Scores" = immediate value, specific action
- "API Docs" = clearer than "View API"
- Lower friction than "Get Started" (unclear what that means)

---

## Stats Section

### Stat #2: Trust Dimensions

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
7
Trust Dimensions
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
7
Reliability Metrics
```

**Why better:** "Metrics" is clearer than "dimensions" (less academic)

---

### Stat #3: Interactions

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
9.3K
Interactions
```

**✅ AFTER (Option A):**
```
9.3K
Reports Submitted
```

**✅ AFTER (Option B):**
```
9.3K
Agent Reports
```

**Why better:** Clarifies WHAT interactions (reports, not just page views)

---

### Stat #4: Query Time

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
2-8ms
Query Time
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
<10ms
Response Time
```

**Alternative:** Move this to "Production Ready" feature card or footer

**Why better:** Simplified range, "response time" more universally understood

---

## Features Section

### Feature #1: Multi-Dimensional

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
📊 Multi-Dimensional
Track reliability, uptime, latency, error rate, quality, freshness, 
and security across 7 dimensions.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
📊 Complete Picture
Compare providers across 7 metrics—uptime, speed, reliability, and more. 
See real performance, not just marketing claims.
```

**Why better:**
- "Complete Picture" = benefit, not feature name
- Lists examples (uptime, speed) but doesn't exhaustively list all 7
- Contrast with "marketing claims" = emotional hook

---

### Feature #2: Community-Driven

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
⚡ Community-Driven
Trust scores update based on agent reports. 
Synthetic baseline refined by real usage.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
⚡ Crowd-Verified
Real agents report real outcomes. Scores improve as more tools are tested—
no vendor bias, just data.
```

**Why better:**
- Removes "synthetic baseline" jargon
- Emphasizes "no vendor bias" (differentiator)
- Active voice ("agents report" vs "scores update")

---

### Feature #3: Smart Discovery

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
🎯 Smart Discovery
Find trusted providers by category. 
Get ranked lists instantly with confidence levels.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```

See which tools deliver, with sample sizes and trust levels.
```

**Why better:**
- "Instant Rankings" = speed + utility
- "Search by task" = concrete action
- "which tools deliver" = outcome-focused

---

### Feature #4: MCP Native

```
🔌 MCP Native
Built as MCP server. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, 
and any MCP client.
```

**✅ AFTER (Option A - Keep technical):**

and any MCP-compatible tool.
```

**✅ AFTER (Option B - More accessible):**
```
🔌 Works Everywhere
Install once, use in Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and any MCP tool. 
No platform lock-in.
```

**Recommendation:** Keep Option A (technical audience expects "MCP")

---

### Feature #5: Confidence Tracking

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
🛡️ Confidence Tracking
Know when scores are reliable. 
High/medium/low confidence based on sample size.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
🛡️ No Guesswork
Know when scores are reliable. 
Every score shows confidence level based on sample size.
```

**Why better:**
- "No Guesswork" = benefit (peace of mind)
- Second sentence clearer construction
- Removes unexplained "high/medium/low" list

---

### Feature #6: Production Ready

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
🚀 Production Ready
100% test coverage, all tests passing, comprehensive documentation.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
🚀 Battle-Tested
Used in production by AI agents making real decisions.

```

**Why better:**

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Get detailed trust data for a provider. 
Returns score, reliability, confidence, flags, and history.
```

**✅ AFTER:**

```

**Why better:**
- "before you use it" = use case
- "red flags" more concrete than "flags"
- "performance history" clearer than "history"

---

### Tool #2: trustscore_report

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Report interaction outcomes. Scores update based on your reports. 
Help improve data quality.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
Report your results after each interaction. 
Your reports make scores more accurate—for you and everyone else.
```

**Why better:**
- "after each interaction" = when to use
- Reframes as mutual benefit, not charity
- "for you and everyone else" = community value

---

### Tool #3: trustscore_rank

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Get ranked list of providers by trust score. 
Filter by task type and minimum score.
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
Compare multiple providers at once. 
Filter by task, set minimum thresholds, get ranked results instantly.
```

**Why better:**
- "at once" = efficiency
- "set minimum thresholds" clearer than "minimum score"
- "instantly" = speed benefit

---

## CTA Banner (Bottom)

```

**✅ AFTER:**
```

- Removes redundant "from GitHub" (obvious from CTA)

---

## Sample Trust Scores Section

### Section Subheading

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Based on 9.3K synthetic interactions
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
Based on 9.3K agent reports
```

**Why better:** "agent reports" clearer than "synthetic interactions"

---
